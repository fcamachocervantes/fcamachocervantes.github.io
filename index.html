                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Francisco! I'm recent graduate in Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines
                    with a focus in Information Security and Privacy. I'm a Colorado native and I'm a first generation
                    university graduate. Education is immensively important to me whether it be learning new things for myself
                    or having the opportunity to teach others about the subjects I'm passionate about. During my time at Mines I've
                    had the opportunity to work with a very diverse group of peers and to learn from them about their majors that
                    they're all deeply passionate about. Now that I've graduated I hope I can continue to experience these wonderful
                    moments learning from others and their experiences while also being able to utilize my own knowledge and passion
                    in my own work and pursuits.
