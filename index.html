                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Francisco! I'm a Senior in Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines
                    with a focus in Information Security and Privacy. I was born and raised in Denver, CO with
                    my 3 older siblings. My parents are from Guanajuato, Mexico along with my other relatives.
                    I'm the first in my family to have the opportunity to attend University. Education has always
                    been important to me and satisfying my curiosity through learning is my largest drive in life.
                    Studying computer science was part of that to me because computers always seemed so mystical
                    and I couldn't understand how they worked. As I grew up and began to peel that curtain away 
                    and learn the processes and mechanisms of computer hardware and software I realized just how
                    much I loved the interaction between people and computers. The endless possibilities when people
                    interact with computers is such an amazing thing but can also lead to a large array of security
                    and privacy vulnerabilities. Learning and creating new protocols and practices to protect people
                    while they work with computers is my biggest curiosity and I'm doing what I can to satisfy it
                    by learning more about the massive field of Information Security and Privacy. I hope I can begin
                    to put into practice all that I've learned and am still learning into practice so I can hopefully
                    start making a difference and protecting people's data and privacy myself.
