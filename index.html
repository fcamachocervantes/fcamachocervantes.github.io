          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Francisco Camacho a recent graduate from Colorado School of
          Mines with a Bachelor's in Computer Science focused in Cybersecurity
          and Software Development. I'm a first generation college graduate in
          my family, having graduated with Cum Laude (with honors).
        </p>
        <p>
          I attended Colorado School of Mines as a President's Scholarship and
          Colorado Scholars Fund recipient. These merit based scholarships
          provided me with the opportunity to attend Mines and be the first in
          my family to attend university and earn my bachelor's degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time at Mines I was able to experience a rigorous learning
          environment learning from Industry professionals about best practices
          when it comes to software development, information security and
          privacy, teamwork, and the entire development pipeline. I was provided
          ample opportunities to experiment and develop projects with teammates
          across various disciplines at Mines. My ability to communicate
          effectively with students of various backgrounds and disciplines was
          developed and rigorously tested. My ability to plan and work on large
          scale projects spanning multiple months and meet project deadlines
          were honed throughout my time at Mines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of all my time at Mines provided me with a curiosity to learn as
          much as I can, not only about Computer Science and it's applications
          but also about the various other disciplines taught at Mines. Mines
          requires us to gain some insight into the other majors such as
          Chemistry, Physics, Math, and various Engineering disciplines. These
          requirements for all majors are a cornerstone to why I loved my time
          at Mines, because they emphasized the importance teaching us new
          things and giving us new perspectives on how to create a solution.
